What is this?
=============
If you are a college or a high school student who wants to do photography but don't have the luxury of paying for a real intervalometer, but instead spent all of your darn money on your GDC, then this repository is for you.

This repository has the necesarry code to turn your Ti-84 (or some other GDC) into a intervalometer. To get started keep reading.

Requirements
============

*   You'll need a Texas Instruments TI-84 (Plus or not, doesn't matter). Or any Texas Instruments with an IO jack at the top, not sure if it would work (you're free to try anyway).
*   Any camera with a intervalometer port. Mine (for example) is a [Canon EOS 1300D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS_1300D).
*   You'll need a 2.5mm audio cable on BOTH ends. The longer it is, the easier it will be to use.

How do I set this up?
=====================
In this repository you'll notice that we have two files [TIMELAPS]](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KingLorax/Ti-84-Intervalometer/master/TIMELAPS.TIPROGRAM) and [TIMEWAIT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KingLorax/Ti-84-Intervalometer/master/TIMEWAIT.TIPROGRAM). What you need to do is write these two programs in your GDC.

Once you're done copying you can proceed to use it.  

How do I use this?
==================
*   Plug one side into the camera and the other one into the IO jack of your Texas Instruments TI-84 (Plus or not, doesn't really matter).
*   Start your camera and your GDC. (make sure the camera has appropriate settings first, lol)
*   On your GDC EXECute the TIMELAPS program.
*   It will ask you for the value of N. Enter the number of pictures you want to take.
*   Then it will ask you for the value of I. Here, enter the number of seconds between your pictures. For example, value of five will take a picture once every five seconds.

Now, it will proceed to take pictures.

Great, you got yourself a nice little intervalometer.
